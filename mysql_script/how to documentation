The script/tool build in Python 3.

Please download & install Editor "Pycharm Community Edition".
Install mysql in python project interpreter or using pip.

Command: pip install mysql-connector-python

Open project in pychram and set/configure python 3 interpreter.
If you will need my help while running script, I need teamviewer or anydesk ID for connecting
with your desktop and I will do setup and will guide you live how to run script.
